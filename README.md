# Fruit Vector Graphs
A project using the Reddit API to plot each of the fruit vectors, made by a friend of mine, on different types of graphs.

# What is this?
Like it says above, this library(?) produces graphs based on the popularity of fruit vector memes using [PRAW](https://pypi.org/project/praw/).

# Why?
Hubris.
